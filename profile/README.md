# OpenJobFeed - A Unified, Open Standard for Job Listings

OpenJobFeed is an open-source initiative to create a **unified**, **machine-readable format for job listings**, making it easier for companies to share job opportunities and for developers to build job-related applications.


## Why OpenJobFeed?

- **Standardized Format** - A simple, flexible JSON-based schema for job postings.

- **Simple & Automated** - Companies can publish job openings as a machine-readable feed on their own domain.
